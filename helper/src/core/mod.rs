//! The engine: probing, project parsing, constraint solving, and bootstrap.
//!
//! Everything here is editor-agnostic. The LSP and CLI frontends are thin callers
//! over [`solver::assess`] (read-only) and [`setup::run`] (mutating). F2 (hardware)
//! slots into [`solver`] via [`crate::matrix`]; F4 (buffer diagnostics) attaches in
//! the LSP layer and reuses the same [`Assessment`].
